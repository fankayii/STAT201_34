    "- Relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your proposal.\n",
    "- Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project. Your question should involve one or more random variables of interest, spread across two or more categories that are interesting to compare. For example, you could consider the annual maxima river flow at two different locations along a river, or perhaps gender diversity at different universities. Of the response variable, identify one location parameter (mean, median, quantile, etc.) and one scale parameter (standard deviation, inter-quartile range, etc.) that would be useful in answering your question. Justify your choices."
