    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Crime brings chills down everyone’s spines, with theft being the most common type of crime in Canada ([Government of Canada](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/state-etat/2019rpt-rap2019/p7.html)). Section 322 of the Canadian Criminal Code defines \"theft\" as \"fraudulently and without colour of right\" taking someone's property or converting its ownership ([Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-322.html)). Understanding crime statistics is crucial to enhancing community relations, measuring prevention initiatives, and minimizing risks by making better decisions ([Vancouver Police Department](https://vpd.ca/crime-statistics/)). In this paper, we will study the proportion of theft crime in Dunbar-Southlands and West Point Grey, the two neighbourhoods closest to the University of British Columbia Vancouver campus ([UBC Vantage College](https://vantagecollege.ubc.ca/blog/your-guide-neighborhoods-vancouver)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "Is the proportion of theft occurring in the neighbourhood of West Point Grey higher than Dunbar-Southlands? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "The random variable of interest for comparing is the proportion of theft in the neighbourhoods of Dunbar-Southlands and West Point Grey. Of the response variable, differences in proportions is the location parameter and standard error is the scale parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis $H_0$: There is no difference between the proportion of theft in the neighbourhoods of Dunbar-Southlands and West Point Grey.\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis $H_A$: The proportion of theft in West Point Grey is higher than in Dunbar-Southlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Null Hypothesis $H_0$ | Alternate Hypothesis $H_A$ |\n",
    "| --- | ----------- |\n",
    "|  $$H_0: p_w - p_d = 0$$ | $$H_A: p_w - p_d > 0$$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "To conduct our research, we use the [Vancouver Police Department (VPD) crime data](https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/), which includes information on the different types of crimes in Vancouver from 2003 to 2023. We will be focusing on crimes within the last 5 complete years, 2018 to 2022, in the neighbourhoods of Dunbar-Southlands and West Point Grey in order to base our research upon more recent and prevalent information about contemporary crimes."

Therefore, we need to check for the large enough sample size condition, such that `n(1-p) >= 10` and `np >= 10`. We also need to assume that the sample is random and independent. By carrying out a two-sample independent z-test, we will use the following test statistic:\n",

    "\n",

Afterwards, we will take a large number of bootstrap samples from our crime sample dataset to create a bootstrap distribution for a difference in proportions.\n",

    "For both approaches, we can find the p-value to check for any statistically significant findings to decide whether we can reject the null hypothesis or not under a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.

We can then say across all 95% confidence intervals that could be calculated, we can expect that 95% of the intervals contain the true difference in theft crime proportions. Similarly, the p-value of using asymptotics and bootstrapping are both at approximately 0.3, which is significantly greater than the 5% significance level, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, we do not have enough evidence to demonstrate that West Point Grey has a higher theft rate than Dunbar-Southlands, resulting in the possibility of committing a Type II Error."

    "# 3. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "In our study of determining whether or not there is a statistically significant difference in the proportion of theft crime occurring in West Point Grey against Dunbar-Southlands, we fail to reject the null hypotehsis stating there is no difference between the neighbourhoods at a significance level of 5%. Originally, we expected that West Point Grey to have a higher proportion of theft compared to Dunbar-Southlands as population density would be higher closer to campus, leading to a higher theft rate. However, both asymptotic analysis based upon the Central Limit Theorem and bootstrap analysis fail to reject the null hypothesis. We obtained confidence intervals containing the value of 0, or no difference, and achieved p-values of approximately 0.3. This means that using both the theory-based approach and simulation-based approach gave us the same conclusion, so we can be relatively confident in our answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "Our findings could impact residents living in either neighbourhoods, if not both, to be more proactive and aware of theft in their area and enforce relevant safety measures. Since we specifically targetted the neighbourhoods of West Point Grey and Dunbar-Southlands, two of the most popular neighbourhoods for off-campus housing for University of British Columbia students, then these students can become more informed on the theft proportions in these places. However, since we discovered no statistical significance between the two neighbourhoods in terms of theft proportion, then individuals should not be too wary of living in either neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Questions\n",
    "One drawback of our study is that while big data may explain differences in the danger of theft and support governmental measures, it cannot explain individual cases or provide detailed plan of how to minimize the risks. Furthermore, a challenge we face is how to extrapolate our analysis to predict future crime rates, as that is the only important information for reducing crimes. Despite not finding any statistical difference between the proportion of theft in West Point Grey and Dunbar-Southlands, we have further questions regarding the underlying motivations behind theft and what features cause a difference in theft between different neighbourhoods. Not only that, our research raises further questions into proportions of different crime not limited to just theft and not theft, such as homicides or residential break-ins. "
